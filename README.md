# Automotive Radar
Radio detection and ranging (RADAR) was developed during world war II for military applications to detect aircraft. Apart from military use, modern-day Radars is used for civilian applications such as air traffic control, remote sensing, ship safety, etc. The usage of Radars in the automotive industry is increasing significantly to provide both safety and comfort for human drivers. RADAR is considered a key sensor technology for realizing self-driving cars.

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are $$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
